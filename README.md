Massquerade is a puzzle visual novel built with Godot for the
[Winter Melon Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/wmj2025) by [Rat Haven Studios](https://github.com/Rat-Haven-Studios).
The theme for the jam was **"Mask"**.

You are a conscripted killer who was invited to a party. The only hint at who your target is was on a letter you recieved as you arrived. "Traitor".

## How to Play
You must go around and talk to the party guests to determine who the traitor is.

The game is quite simple, it's the mystery that might be a little hard. You have to go around and interact with people to gather clues. 
These clues might open up dialogue options that weren't previously available, even to people you're already talked to before. 
Once you've decided who your target is, that is when you strike. Good luck!
